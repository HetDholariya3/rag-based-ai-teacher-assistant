As you can see data cleaning is the process of identifying and correcting errors and inconsistencies in data to improve its quality and reliability. Now this is the definition from book right? Now you can understand data cleaning is the process of simple you are correcting the data or you are removing the errors which is actually completely clear from this definition. But now why it is required? It's required because you are going to work with the data right? So the data quality is very important. You have the data it doesn't matter how big the data is it can be in kilobytes, megabytes, terabytes, petabytes, gigabytes but if you don't have the quality data then the problem is that it will definitely give you the wrong results and can have many other problems as well when you process the data or when you analyze the data.
