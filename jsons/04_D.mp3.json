    "text": " Hi students, welcome to the new video fundamentals of data module. So what we will learn in this video, understanding the descriptive statistics and what is inferential statistics. So let's talk about descriptive statistics first. So descriptive statistics means that we are summarizing the data or we are describing the data. So we have the main features in the data set and we have a summary. So we can have the mean of the data, we can have the median and the mode which is most frequent value. So you can imagine we can have any column, you can calculate the average. So this is arithmetic mean in the technical terms, but we call it average in day to day life. And the middle value of the data, if it is sorted properly, then the middle value is called as median. And the value which is most frequent, so we call it mode. But we also have the measure of spread, which is standard deviation. Standard deviation is nothing but it's the standard value of the variance. It's a square root of the variance. So what is variance? Variance in simple words that it calculates how far the values are from the mean. So these things can help us to understand our data in a good way. That's why we call it descriptive statistics because it is describing the data. So in for example, let's say you have a list of students grade. So descriptive statistics will help you to understand the average of the grades of the students. And you can also look at how the grades are distributed in the class. So you can look at for the low grades, for the high grades and calculating the average will help you to understand what is the average grade in the class. So descriptive statistics is helpful in understanding your data or summarizing your data. Prudential statistics. These techniques are used to make predictions or generalization about a population based on sample of data. So in simple words, you can see two words here population and sample. So when you are talking about the whole group, we call it population. But when we take a small subset of that group, we call it sample. So let's imagine there are 50 students in a class. Right. If you study all the 50 students, then you are working on population because you are talking about the whole class. But let's say if I take only 10 students from the 50 students, then I have a sample. OK, so I'm not actually working on all these 50 students. I'm just trying to understand these 10 students. It means I'm working on a subset. OK, so that that's why we call it sample. Now, the inferential statistics involves hypothesis testing, confidence interval and regression analysis also. So what are these things? So hypothesis testing means that you are building a hypothesis. So let's imagine that you have there is a new diet plan and you are trying to understand if this diet plan is helping the people to lose weight or not. So we will start building the hypothesis that there is no effect on on the weight of the people using this new diet plan. We will collect the data, we will study the data and then we will make the conclusion. So this is hypothesis testing. Now, what is confidence interval? Confidence interval is very easy to understand in simple words. This is the range where we expect the value to fall. So we are 100 percent sure that the values will be in this range if the confidence interval is 100 percent. But mostly when we do statistical analysis, we take confidence interval as 95 percent. It means that we are 95 percent confident that the values will fall in this range. You can take any range and then you can say that I'm 95 percent confident that the values will fall in this range. So this is 95 percent confidence level in this example. Then what is regression analysis? Regression analysis means that we have a variable and we are predicting this variable by taking the example from another variable. So, for example, let's say I have the prices of the house and the size of the house. So the price of the house is dependent on the size of the house. So I can understand what is the effect of the size of the house on the price of the house. As the size of the house is increasing, the price of the house is also increasing, for example. So this is the regression analysis example. So let's say, for example, if you survey a sample of voters, inferential statistics can help you predict the voting behavior of the entire population based on your sample. This is one more good example of inferential statistics. So in this video, we have learned about the descriptive and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics is used to describe your data and inferential statistics is used to make conclusion or make the inferences from the data. So that's it for this video.
