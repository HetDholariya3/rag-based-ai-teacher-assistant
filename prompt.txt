So you will  learn few things in the later modules that how it's gonna be in the real world  how we change the values and why exactly what is the requirement to change these  things but so far for this video now you can understand that when you have a"},{"title":"F","number":"6","start":292.76,"end":299.68,"text":" data directly from individuals by taking surveys and questions. So it can be an  online survey or it can be an in-person interviews to get the data. Nowadays we  can get the data from IOT devices or sensors. IOT stands for Internet of  Things so you can get the data from different kind of machines and if you  remember we have talked about machine data sources where you are directly"},{"title":"F","number":"6","start":241.08,"end":245.64,"text":" any item right but you don't know what is happening in the back end because  back end there is a database which holds all these values like the information  about the product the stock level the price information so you just click on  buy now and then your order is placed right but what is happening under the  hood you don't have to worry about this. So how this application is interacting"},{"title":"J","number":"10","start":419.64,"end":423.64,"text":" help me to calculate the age of those peoples so there can be many more  examples whenever you are deriving any column or any feature by taking example  from one or more columns in your data set you can call this as feature  engineering so to recap we have understood the data transformation  techniques like aggregation normalization encoding data integration"},{"title":"F","number":"6","start":30.32,"end":34.4,"text":" to retrieve it in a good way then you have to collect it in a database and you  have to store it in a database. So you can store this electronically. Now these  are the names of some most common databases I would say MySQL is an open  source relational database and PostgreSQL is also another database  management system and MongoDB. MongoDB is also another database and this is for"},{"title":"F","number":"6","start":320.28,"end":324.4,"text":" capturing the data from a machine.
