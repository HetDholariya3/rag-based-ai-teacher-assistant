So when you want to organize the data and you want to retrieve it in a good way then you have to collect it in a database and you have to store it in a database. So you can store this electronically. Now these are the names of some most common databases I would say MySQL is an open source relational database and PostgreSQL is also another database management system and MongoDB. MongoDB is also another database and this is for non-relational as well. So we have two kinds of databases like relational databases and non-relational databases.
