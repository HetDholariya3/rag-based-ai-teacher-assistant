So far we have learned about the structured, semi-structured and unstructured and data can also be classified as the qualitative data and the quantitative data. But we can also classify the data as primary data and the secondary data. So what is primary data first? So as per the definition, the data collected directly from first-hand sources specifically for a particular research purpose or project. So basically you are going to collect this data and this is the first-hand data. So you are not getting the data from anywhere. Okay, so you are on the ground level if you are collecting this data. So this is called a primary data and the characteristic for the primary data is that this is original and specific to the research because you are doing research on a particular topic, right? So you will be conducting the interview or you will be collecting this primary data specific to this topic and you are not going to record anything else. So collect it through methods like surveys, experiments, interviews or observations. Let's see an example of primary data like conducting a new survey to understand consumer preferences or you are running an experiment to test a new drug's effectiveness. So you are not getting this data from any source. So this is the first-hand data. In the first example, you are conducting a survey to understand your customers and in the second one, you are running an experiment and this is because a new drug is introduced. So that's why you are doing this first-hand. So this is the primary data which is collected by you. Now what is secondary data? So the data that has been collected and processed by someone else for a purpose other than the current research project. So for example, I have already collected some data and it is stored in a database or it can be an Excel file or can be any file where we can store the data, right? Now you can collect this data as per your requirement, but there can be some other features or you know other information can be present in this data which is of no use for you, right?
